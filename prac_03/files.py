CP1404 - Practical 3
This program will demonstrate my solutions to file reading activities given
in prac_03 README page on GitHub.

Solutions were looked at (When doing Question 3) only for the purpose of checking, and code was edited
accordingly using the solutions as suggestions for better code practice.

# Question 1:
# OUTPUT_FILE = 'name.txt'
# out_file = open(OUTPUT_FILE, 'w')
# out_file.write(input("What is your name?"))
# out_file.close()

# Question 2:
# OUTPUT_FILE = 'name.txt'
# out_file = open(OUTPUT_FILE, 'r')
# print(f"Your name is {out_file.read()}")
# out_file.close()

# Question 3:
# INPUT_FILE = 'numbers.txt'
# in_file = open(INPUT_FILE, 'r')
# number_1 = int(in_file.readline())
# number_2 = int(in_file.readline())
# total = number_1 + number_2
# print(total)

# Question 4:
# INPUT_FILE = 'numbers.txt'
#
# in_file = open(INPUT_FILE, 'r')
#
# total = 0

# for line in in_file:
#     number = int(line)
